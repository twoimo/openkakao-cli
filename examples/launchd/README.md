# launchd

Use these files as a starting point for long-running unattended OpenKakao jobs on macOS.

Recommended shape:

1. use `scripts/install-auto-reply-launchd.sh` for the supervised two-agent setup
2. keep `openkakao-watch-wrapper.sh` and `com.openkakao.watch.plist` only for the legacy single-agent watch path
3. read `docs/auto-reply-launchd-supervision.md` before promoting production mode after a binary change

Guardrails:

- supervised watch uses `ax-watch --service-mode`
- preflight mode has no hook executor
- production mode passes `--hook-path` and never legacy `--hook-cmd`
- treat GUI/TCC preflight as the only valid proof after binary changes
- use `--state-root /absolute/path` on the install/status/doctor/uninstall scripts when the default root is not appropriate

Operational checks:

```bash
sh scripts/status-auto-reply-launchd.sh [--state-root /absolute/path/to/state-root]
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.openkakao.auto-reply.health
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.openkakao.auto-reply.watch
```

Legacy single-agent unload:

```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openkakao.watch.plist
```
